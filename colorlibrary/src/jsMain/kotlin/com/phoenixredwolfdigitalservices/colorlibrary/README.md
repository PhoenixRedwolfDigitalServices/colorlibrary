Color Library based on Android for Kobweb
===========================================

This library was created to bring the ease of adding colors using hex codes to the world of Kobweb web development. You can use the [Material Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom) to create your custom color theme and then copy the android color file you output directly into the main Color.kt file in your project.

Once imported you can then create your theme by following the example in the Theme file.
